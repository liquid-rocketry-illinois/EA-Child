  SD card datalogger

  This example shows how to log data from three analog sensors
  to an SD card using the SD library.

  The circuit:
   analog sensors on analog ins 0, 1, and 2
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4 (for MKRZero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)
